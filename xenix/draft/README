                           Joe's Drafting Program


To run the program, type:

	draft filename

	This will load the image from the file, or create a new file if
necessary.

To draw lines:

	Use the arrow keys to move the cursor to one end of the line you
want.  Hit the space bar to set the mark at that point.  Use the arrow keys
to move the cursor to the other end of the line you want.  Hit 'l' and a
line will be drawn between the cursor and the mark.

To enter text:

	Use the arrow keys to move to the cursor to the lower left point of
where you want the text.  Hit 'i'.  All character you type now will be
entered as text.  You may use backspace for erasing mistakes.  Hit return
when you're done entering the text.  Notice that the text is always the same
size as the grid points.

	l			Draw a line between the mark and the cursor

	c			Scroll the window so that the cursor is at
