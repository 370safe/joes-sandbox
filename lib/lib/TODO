 macro cmd rc

- Figure out better way of creating global command tables
- How to make rc file more generic
  - perhaps a linked list of 'rc' handlers?
- use continuations in macros
- use older new queue library?

- Figure out way to make joe's screen drawing functions fast while keeping
  scrn so that it can call any output function

- scrn global variables?  eliminate all global variables if possible
- should environment variables be able to override ttgtsz?

- read and write to streams with the file buffering stuff

- document other vs/va functions?

- note that macsta was removed from kbd and must therefore be called when
the macro is run

- use select() in tty?

Btree:
 - Figure out how to do in-place update.
     - Saves us from having to do search/delete/insert sequence

 - Figure out ways to reduce number of btree searches needed
     - Have a cache of recently accessed records with pointers to record's
       location in the btree.  Cache becomes invalid when btree structure
       changes.

 - Allow multiple tables per btree file.
