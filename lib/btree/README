Btree library is in btree.c/btree.h

Other files contain other library functions.  btree requires these:

	vfile 		buffered I/O
	queue		doubly linked list needed for vfile
	zstr		string routines for vfile
	vs		string routines for btree and vfile
	blocks		fast block move routines for vfile
	random		random number generator for vfile
	path		file name functions for vfile

See 'btree.h', 'vfile.h' and 'vs.h' for full documentation.

Type 'make' to create an example user interface program.  See 'main.c'


Files 'index.c' and 'index.h' are dynamic hash file manager functions.  They
maintain an automatically expanding/shrinking hash table of record indexes
in a file.
