To compile AACC:

  cc -O aacc.c -o aacc

To look at the man page:

  nroff -man aacc.1 | more

Instructions for the examples:

calc0
-----

This is a simple four-function integer calculator.

To compile:

 aacc calc0.y
 cc calc0.c yytab.c -o calc

To use:

 >calc '1+2'
 =3

 >calc '1+2 4'
 =3
 =4

As in languages like C, this example resolves the ambiguity between subtract
and negate by trying to make the expression as long as possible:

 >calc '1+2 -3'
 =0

calc1
-----

This is a four function floating point calculator with elaborate
error reporting and run-time conflict resolution:

To compile:

 aacc -type 'struct value *' calc1.y
 cc calc1.c yytab.c -o calc

To use:

 >calc '1/2'
 = .5

Unlike the previous languages like C, this example decides the ambiguity
between subtract and negate by using a run-time conflict resolution
function.  Whichever use of '-' "looks" correct will be the one chosen:

 >calc '1+2-3'
 = 0

 >calc '1+2 -3'
 = 3
 = -3

 >calc '1 + 2 - 3'
 = 0

 >calc '1 + 2  - 3'
 = 3
 = -3

Some examples of elaborate error reporting:

 >calc '10*7-5+15 12*13*/16'
 = 80
 Syntax error:
 10*7-5+15 12*13*/16
 ----------------^

 >calc '(10+20)/(90-30*3)'
 Divide by zero:
 (10+20)/(90-30*3)
