Object oriented features:

	Function declaration should have a path:
		fn a.b() ...

		Create member function b within object a.

		Otherwise we have to do this: a.b = fn((), { })

	We already have this:
		a.x()    a will be the x's mom

	Maybe add some way to explicitly set the environment during a
	function call:

		javascript has z.a.call(n,...)
			(a is called with mom set to b instead of z)
			(not really mom: it's self)

	Using this technique, glblvars always ends up in the search path.
