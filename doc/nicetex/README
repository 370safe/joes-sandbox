                       ASCII Text Documentation System

Directions:

	Edit the document.  It should be called NAME.txt

	Type make

	View it with: make view
	  or: acroread ../NAME_out/NAME.pdf

	Print it with: make print
	  or: lpr ../NAME_out/NAME.ps

Formatting commands:

	Paragraphs are separated with blank lines.

	.space	nnn			nnn inches of vertical space

	.span				Vertical whitespace spring (equals
					enough space to fill current page).
					All spans on a page have equal size.

		For example, a title centered 1/3 from top of page:
			.page
			.span
			.centered title
			.span
			.span
			.page


	.centered text			A centered line

	.set header text		Header text.

	.page				Insert a page break

	.contents			Table of contents

	.figures			List of figures

	.tables				List of tables

	.body				Begin body text

	. chapter			Chapter
	.. section			Section
	... subsection			Subsection

	.table tag title		A table with borders
		|c2	|l2	|l	|
		|header	|header	|header	|
		|data	|data	|data	|
		|data	|data	|data	|
	<blank line>

		Note: first row of table data is column widths and
                      justifications.  Possible justifications are l for
                      left, c for centered, r for right.  The column width
                      is in inches.

                      If one column does not have a width, the table will be
                      made as wide as the margins, and that column will get
                      the space not used by the others.

                      The second row of a table contains column headers.

                      A table may have only one column, but must have at
                      least two rows: the widths and justifications row and
                      the headers row.

                      Tag is a name for the table which allows it to be
                      referenced from elsewhere in the document.

	.alignment			A table with no borders
		|c2	|l2	|l	|
		|header	|header	|header	|
		|data	|data	|data	|
		|data	|data	|data	|
	<blank line>

	.figure tag file title		A .eps file figure.

Escape sequences allowed within text:

	Refer to figures and tables as follows:  see table \ref{tag} on
	page \pageref{tag}.

	.centered \subtitlefont Text

	.centered \titlefont Text

	This will be \bold text \textfont.

	This will be \italic text \textfont.

Escape sequences:

	All characters are printed as-is, except for \.  To print \ use \\.

TeX mode:

	Everything between any \ and a following space or end of line is
	passed as-is to TeX.

Math mode:

	Everything between any \$ and a following $ is passed as-is to TeX,
	but in math mode.

        In math mode:

	Use { } to group things together.  The { }s will not be printed.  For
        example, used the { } to indicate which terms are to be above a
        fraction bar or below a fraction bar.

        Use \times for a multiplication symbol: x\times y

        Use \over for a fraction bar: {a+b+c+d}\over {x+y+z}

        Use ^ for exponentiation: e^{j\times x}

        Unfortunately math mode doesn't know about spaces between words.  So
	you can either limit yourself to single word or character variables
	or put in explicit spaces with \enspace: data\enspace rate

        There are two fonts for math mode.  For equations which are in the
        middle of a paragraph, use the default one: \$x=y+z$.

        For equations floating in space use \displaystyle{ }:

	.alignment
		|c|
		|\$\displaystyle{x=y+z}$|

        (Note that the .alignment is used to center the equation between the margins).

How to get special characters in TeX mode (these escape sequences are not
normally necessary):

	\_
	\$
	\#
	\&
	\%
	$>$
	$<$
	/
	?
	.
	,
	;
	:
	'
	"
	[
	]
	(
	)
	-
	+
	=
	*
	@
	\^{}\kern -2pt   {\^{}} is better
	\~{}\kern -2pt   {\~{}} is better
	!
	`
	$|$
	$\backslash$
	$\{$
	$\}$

Math within nicetex:

	Anything within \{  } is treated as a floating point expression and
	is evaluated and then printed.  Currently, the following operators
	are supported:

		+
		-
		*
		/
		( )

	In addition, variables may be assigned and accessed (the order of assignment to variables
	is undefined).

		\{a+4}		Prints 24
		\{a=20}		Prints 20

Spreadsheet stuff:

	Within a table math expression can refer spatially to other math expressions:

		R		First expression in cell to right.
		RR		First expression in 2nd cell to right.
		RRR...		etc...
		L		First expression in cell to left.
		LL		First expression in 2nd cell to left.
		r		Expression to right
		rr		2nd expression to right
		l		Expression to left
		ll		2nd expression to left
		U		First expression in cell above.
		D		First expression in cell below.

	These can be combined, so that DR means go one cell down, then one
	cell right, and then take the first expression.

	So for example, this can be used to keep position values updates based
	on size:

		|Position		|Size		|
		|\{D+DR}		|\{3}		|
		|\{D+DR}		|\{22}		|
		|\{D+DR}		|\{2}		|
		|\{0}			|\{5}		|

Bugs:

  [fixed:]
  No control sequences (most importantly underbars and numbers) allowed in
  table names, like: CRC_SYNC3
  [this is now fixed: names like CRC_SYNC3 are transformed into NtCRCXfoSYNCXdd].

  [fixed: (at least for underlines, other sequences may appear incorrect in acrobat
   .pdf file table of contents)]
  Can't have control sequences (underbars) in:
        figure and table titles
        or after ., .., and ...

        (they end up in external files).

  Should use a larger font.

  Needs a typewriter mode.
  Needs a bullet or list mode.

  No way to print | from within a table.

  Should automatically leave out table of figures if there are no figures.
  Should automatically leave out table of tables if there are no tables.

  Each math mode equation must be only on one line.

  Should have set footer = with \date
