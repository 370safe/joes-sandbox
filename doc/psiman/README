Name
	psiman - Psychic Man-Page Formatter

Syntax
	psiman [ options ] [ file ]
	psicvt < prn > ascii

Description
	_Psiman_ is a text formatter (similar to nroff) which takes as input
a simple ASCII text file with almost no formatting sequences.  _Psiman_
guesses where formatting sequences would go and formats the document as if
these sequences where actually there and the file was processed by
nroff -man.  The advantage of this method is that the input text file is much
easier to write and comprehend if the text formatter is not available for
some reason.

Usage
	_psiman_ with a file name formats the named file and sends the
result to the standard output.  _psiman_ without a file name expects the
file to be sent to its standard input.

	_psicvt_ can be used to convert an existing man page to the _psiman_
format.  For example:

		man tar | cvt 

	Note however that _psicvt_ does not work properly if its input
document was filled (_groff_ does this by default).  Also tables are
probably not formatted correctly.

Options
	-ansi	Assume the output device is an ANSI terminal.  Also assume
that the user wants paging off.  This is the default output device.

	-ascii	Assume that the output device can not process any control
sequences.  Also assume that the user wants paging off.

	-color	Assume that the output is an ANSI color terminal.  Also
assume that the user wants paging off.

	-hp	Assume that the output is an HP Laser Printer which has 60
lines on a page.

	-lp	Assume that the output is some type of impact printer which
has 66 lines on a page.

	-paging	Enable paging.  The header and page number will be printed
on the top and bottom of each page.  Also the top and bottom margin values
will be enforced and the last page will be finished off.

	--paging
		Disable paging.

	-cols nn
		Assume that the output page is _nn_ columns wide.

	-rows nn
		Assume that the output page has _nn_ lines.

	-l nn
		Set the left margin to _nn_.  The default is 5.

	-r nn
		Set the right margin to _nn_.  The default is 5.

	-t nn
		Set the top margin to _nn_.  The default is 4.

	-b nn
		Set the bottom margin to _nn_.  The default is 4.

	-header 'text'
		Set the header to _text_.  If this option is not given, the
header is the file name.

	-fill	Enable filling.  Paragraphs will be filled with spaces so
that the right margin is even.

Heuristics
	_psiman_ uses the following heuristics to determine the formatting
sequences:

	- Text surrounded with underlines '_' is emphasized (italicized,
underlined or emboldened- depending on the output device).

	- If a line begins with whitespace followed by an unpunctuated
sequence of only a few words or characters followed by the end of the line,
it is emboldened.

	- If a line begins with whitespace followed by a sequence of only a
few characters which does not appear to be a sentence, followed by more
whitespace, the sequence is emboldened.

	- Parts of a line which are separated by tabs or large sequences of
spaces (3 or more) are assumed to be a table of some sort, and the starting
column of each section will be preserved.  Also entries will be combined
with lines of the same format which immediately follow.

Bugs & Improvements
	- Tables need more support.

	- Post-script output and proportionally-spaced fonts are not
supported.

	- An explicit formatting sequence is needed to delineate text which
should not be formatted (like C listings).

	- An explicit formatting sequence is needed to delineate text which
should not be split across pages.

	- The widow and orphan elimination should work for section names as
well as paragraphs.
