                          Label Typesetting System


A label source file contains a set of label definitions, each in the
following format:

:CODE:x:y:z...			# Define a label
body				# The text to be printed

CODE is the code you type into the Psion to bring up the label.  X, y, etc.
are displayed on the screen of the Psion after you enter the code to verify
that you have the correct label.

Also, the fields x, y, z, etc. may be used in the text of the label by
putting [arg1], [arg2], [arg3], etc. in the text of the label.

Text in the body of the label is printed as-is, with the exception of these 
formatting control sequences:


[save name args] ... []		# Save some text
				# 'args' is a list of substitution
				# parameters.  For example, if
				# [save x q]my name is [q][] is retreived
				# with [x joe], the text 'my name is joe'
				# is generated.

[name args]			# Retreive text

[fill]				# Fill remainder of line as a paragraph

[indent n]text			# Indent paragraph/text by n chars

text~text~text			# Center/Justify text
text~				# Left justified
~text				# Right justified
~text~				# Centered
left~right			# Left and right justified
~x~y~				# Two columns

[upc code]			# Print bar code

[offset amnt]			# Set offset from left edge of label

[width amnt]			# Set width of label

[font n width height]		# Select font and size of font
				# Width and height multiply the normal width
				# and height of the font- except for the
				# variable width fonts (7 & 8); where they
				# set the actual size
