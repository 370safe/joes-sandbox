Partition Archiver

  phantom -c archive-file-name     Create archive from partition

  phantom -x archive-file-name     Extract archive to partition

  Archive file should be on a partition different from the one
  being archived.  Phantom will show the partition table and ask
  you to choose one of them to archive.

  - You should do a 'smartdrv /c' before running phantom if you
    have smartdrv running

  - This program can not move or resize partitions - it can only
    save and restore them
