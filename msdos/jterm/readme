JTERM is a simple vtxxx/ansi terminal emulator for MS-DOS.  The function
keys generate the same codes as the Xenix console.  If jterm receives a
Ctrl-F, it toggles a parallel printer function.

This is a fairly complete emulation of a vt220; the only missing features
being: double width/height lines, alternate/ definable character sets and
132 column mode.

Characters other than 6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,27,132,133,136,141,155:

                Insert all characters to end of line if insert mode is set,
                then type ASCII character and move right unless at right margin.
                If at right margin and magic-wrap is set, then the next time we
                get a typeable character a NL is executed first unless there
                was an intervening control sequence.

6               Toggle pass-through print mode.  This is a non-portable
                extension.

ESC [ 1 K       Erase from beginning of line to cursor
ESC [ 2 K       Erase entire line

ESC [ n X       Erase n characters from cursor to right.  If n is zero or
                missing, erase one character.  Never erases past end of line.

ESC [ r ; c H   Set cursor row/column.  If either r or c are missing, or
                either is zero, 1 is assumed.  Is relative to top margin and
                will not go beyond bottom margin if top-margin relative
                positioning is set.

ESC [ n C       Move right n positions.  n is assumed to be 1 if it is zero or
                missing.  Never go past right margin.

ESC [ n D       Move left n positions.  n is assumed to be 1 if it is zero or
                missing.  Never go past left margin.

ESC [ n A       Move up n positions.  n is assumed to be 1 if it is zero or
                missing.  Never go past top margin or top of screen.  Never
                scroll.

ESC [ n B       Move down n positions.  n is assumed to be 1 if it is zero or
                missing.  Never go past bottom margin of bottom of screen.
                Never scroll.

ESC [ g         Clear tab stop at cursor column
ESC [ 3 g       Clear all tab stops

ESC [ n M       Delete n lines (n is 1 if it's missing or 0) from cursor to
