Priority:

  - Pop up prompt, single character query
      (we need grab for this)

  - Message which disappears on next keypress
      (special event for this?  non-greedy grab?)

- Create application:

  - tie in with topen/etc.


billto on left
shipto on right
direction on bottom

commands: get billto, find billto, save, abort
get shipto, find shipto, new shipto, save, abort



- Basic stuff:

  - scrn/bug: eraeol/outatr: deal with last row, last column problem.

  - Hot keys: we're getting them because children copy standard kmap

  - We need two-level focus for multi application programs

  - I think we're making too many Kmaps

  - I think we're going to need borders - we can avoid them for now by
    making explicit border windows.

- Create a few widgets:

  - Field

    - Force uppercase.  Delete leading and trailing spaces.
    - Use Edit for Field?

  - Editor

    - Make update stuff more automatic
      but how?  flags in the keymap? hooks before we get to keymap?

      no flags: put prefix/postfix functions in edit commands.
      non-edit commands: must defocus the editor first.

      put echk in list commands.
      list gets defocused before exit, etc.

      there should be a defocus all command.  (can it fail?)

    - Where to do mechk in list

    - More functions, especially word wrap, pgup pgdn
