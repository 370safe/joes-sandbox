stheight, but also from configurenotify

Todo from notif-0.4:

Misc

	- Create an example for each widget

	- Improve the documentation

	- Bezier should generate output which matches scalable icon macro
	  language input (now it just emits the bezier control points).

We need these missing widgets:

	- Option box (edit widget with attached menu of choices).  The menu
	  here needs to be scrollable.

	- Tiled window widget (where user can move horz or vert. separation
	  line).

	- Spreadsheet thing (where user can resize column widths).

	- File selector

	- Spinbuttons (numeric control with inc/dec buttons)

	- Thermometer/progress bar

	- Tree displayer (I.E., like for directory selection)

	- Printer selector

	- Multi-line editor

Improve existing widgets:

  Dragdrop

	- drag & drop should have icon attached to mouse pointer

  Edit

	- need drag & drop movement in edit widget

  Index

	- index card widget should be able to handle more tabs than which
          can fit across the top line.

  Text

	- text widget needs formatting escape sequences

  Scrolling

	- scroll bar slider should be a window

	- PgUp/PgDn areas in scroll bars should repeat
		<done>

	- Middle & right button should be scroll up/down as in athena widgets

	- Wheel scrolling should work

	- List cursors should tell scroller that they have changed: thus
	  scroller will always keep cursor on screen.

	- Think about how keys should be linked to the scroll bars

  Lists

	- Lists need selection capability.  Ctrl-return/ctrl-left button
	  adds / removes item from selection.

	- When lists have focus, can use keyboard to move cursor.

  Menus

        - Need deactivated menu entries

	- Need to be able to scroll long menus / long menus should be split
	  into seperate columns

  	- Need cute menu entry with icon on left

Improvements to core

	- Fix all drawing functions to take into account multiple expose
	  events

	- Need to handle application death event

	- Make sure we can set and retreive all componant widgets, I.E., so
	  that colors can be set.  Don't know if there should be polymorphic
	  functions for this, or just use structure access.

	- Do we have mouse icon slot in widgets?

	- Need easy way to send simulated keypress or mouse clicks to
	  widgets.

	- Should use callbacks in serv.

	- Need to make callbacks type safe (or at least portable).

	- Eliminate all compiler warnings
