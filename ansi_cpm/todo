missing bdos functions:
	3 get reader input
	4 write punch output
	5 write listing output
	7 get i/o byte
	8 set i/o byte
	27 get alloc address
	28 write protect disk
	30 set file attributes

something wrong when winstall is run

something wrong when 'e' is given to ed.com

provide simple key to exit simulator?

mount directories as drives in bdos emulator:  ./cpm --A /foo --B /bar ...

take yaze z80 simulator: it's probably more accurate (anyway it passes a CPU tester).

improve putunix / getunix so that you can supply just a single file name

include a cpm disk manager utility: find one
