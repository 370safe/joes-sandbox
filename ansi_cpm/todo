missing bdos functions:
	3 get reader input
	4 write punch output
	5 write listing output
	7 get i/o byte
	8 set i/o byte
	27 get alloc address
	28 write protect disk
	30 set file attributes

allow ^Z to work

allow ESC alone to work

provide simple key to exit simulator?

mount directories as drives in bdos emulator:  ./cpm --A /foo --B /bar ...

take yaze z80 simulator: it's probably more accurate (anyway it passes a CPU tester).
